Furthermore, overexpression of Netrin-1 and Netrin-3 correlates with poor patient outcomes, as it enhances cell survival under dormant conditions and facilitates greater metastatic spread in xenograft models. These findings underscore the importance of Netrin-1 signaling in mediating cancer cell dormancy and metastasis, suggesting potential therapeutic targets within this pathway for improving outcomes in HGSOC patients.\n\nPMID:39067640;PATHWAY_NAME:\"Caspase activation via Dependence Receptors in the absence of ligand\": Netrin-1 (NTN1) plays a critical role in various biological processes, including neuronal connectivity and cancer progression. In the context of the pathway \"Caspase activation via Dependence Receptors in the absence of ligand,\" NTN1's interaction with its receptors, particularly DCC and UNC5, is significant. In the absence of NTN1, DCC is known to initiate cell death signaling through caspase activation, while UNC5 similarly promotes apoptosis. The abstract highlights NTN1's involvement in regulating apoptosis and cell survival, particularly in cancer, where its elevated levels correlate with increased tumorigenic potential. This suggests that NTN1 not only influences neuronal development but also modulates critical apoptotic pathways through its dependence receptors. The dual role of these receptors—promoting survival in the presence of NTN1 and inducing apoptosis when unoccupied—underscores the importance of NTN1 in maintaining cellular homeostasis and its potential as a therapeutic target in cancer treatment. Further investigation into NTN1's molecular interactions is essential for advancing clinical applications.\n\nPMID:39353037;PATHWAY_NAME:\"Caspase activation via Dependence Receptors in the absence of ligand\": Netrin-1 (NTN1) plays a crucial role in axon guidance through its interaction with the dependence receptor DCC (deleted in colorectal cancer). In the absence of Netrin-1, DCC can initiate apoptotic signaling pathways, leading to caspase activation. The abstract highlights the significance of a specific variant in the cytoplasmic tail of DCC, which disrupts its interaction with the WAVE regulatory complex (WRC), essential for mediating netrin-1's attractive signaling. This impairment in DCC function due to the variant is linked to congenital mirror movements (CMMs), illustrating how alterations in DCC can affect neuronal guidance and survival. The findings underscore the dual role of DCC as a dependence receptor, where its function is contingent upon the presence of its ligand, Netrin-1, and how its absence can trigger apoptotic pathways, thereby contributing to cellular outcomes in the context of axon guidance and neuronal health.",
