    "content": "The **TANC1** gene has been identified as a crucial candidate in the context of neurological disorders, primarily due to its role as a postsynaptic scaffold that affects synaptic spine dynamics and the strength of excitatory synapses. Characterized by Ankyrin and tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains, TANC1 also features a newly predicted N-terminal ATPase domain, which may function as a regulated molecular switch for downstream signaling processes [PMID: 28754924]. \n\nTANC1 is particularly significant in the activation of NMDA receptors, which are vital for synaptic plasticity, learning, and memory. These receptors facilitate calcium influx upon activation, underscoring TANC1's involvement in the glutamate receptor pathway. Disruptions in TANC1 function could lead to significant impacts on synaptic processes, potentially contributing to various neurological disorders [PMID: 28754924]. \n\nMoreover, TANC1's role extends to neurotransmitter receptor function and postsynaptic signal transmission, indicating its importance in modulating neuronal activity. This modulation is essential for neuronal projection, extension, and differentiation, suggesting that TANC1 may influence critical signaling pathways that underlie these processes [PMID: 28754924]. \n\nWhile the context does not provide specific interactions with the genes KRAS and DLG4, the overall significance of TANC1 in synaptic signaling mechanisms and its potential implications for neurological conditions are well established. Understanding the molecular functions of TANC1 could offer valuable insights into the shared pathways that contribute to various neurological disorders, highlighting its critical role in maintaining synaptic integrity and function.",
