#### Bugs:
- The autoscroll for the instance view in the event view scroll the whole instance view. But we need to scroll the table content only just like in the schemw view. (some fixed, but not fully ideal)
- go to pathway in the diagram sometimes has weird selection: the pathway selected is stuck in the URL!
- the reset in the comparison table cannot fire event across the browser tabs.
- resizing the nodes cannot change the height of the background for selection. However, sometimes it does work!
- the order inner and outer layers of a compartment needs to be controlled. It is quite random right now.
- bug: display name (e.g. change a regulator for a Regulation) cannot trigger the change to the displayed instance. This needs to be handled as in other instance edit action.
- bug: deleting or updating display name cannot update the loaded instances.
- Bug: the connecting positions are not updated for helper nodes when they are dragged during editing. (??)
- Bug: inner shapes are not updated when resizing nodes.
- Bug (fixed. Kept for future test): When a PE is used as both input and catalyst, enable/disable editing in pathway diagram cannot recovers the original diagram (input or catalyst may get lost, e.g. http://localhost:4200/event_view/instance/453279?select=8848436) - Bug: LLM geneates text for ALDOB having the original template [PMID: 123456] that is not replaced. See Peter's email on Nov 13, 2024.
- Order by display name for a list of black box event
- When an instance has been deleted also make sure that it is removed from the updated store. Make sure that a deleted instance is not editable.
- Search and advanced search needs to consider the instances that have been updated and added (local changes)

#### Deidre
- Bug: After the browser starts or refreshed, click an instance in the changes tab switches to the schema tree. It should  stay at the changes tab. Done 
- TODO: Use the new set of Reactome icons at Figma, designed by the EBI team. Need to check with Eliott.
- TODO: After logging in, the default page should be home. Right now it is the log-in page. Actually it should be the home page always. If the user has not been logged in, change it to the log-in page. Done
- Bug: In the event view, the mouse position is lowed when scroll up/down the instance view. (low priority)
- TODO: When two instances are compared, change "only show edited attribute" to "attributes having different values".
- TODO: List all performed QAs in the QA report even though all QAs are passed. By doing this, the tool gives the curator a list of what have been checked. Done
- TODO: Create a "replace one" and "replace all" for the summation text editor Done
- TODO: Boolean sliders appear to be 'false' when they are 'true' and disabled due to the gray styling for diabled buttons.
- For each type of store lists (update, new) create a limit to the number of instances and add a scroll bar 
- Add checkbox the undo and delete multiple instances at one time
- New instances are not subject to the search 
- Update the css for the batch editing drop downs. Also change the batch edit button location. 



#### TODO:
- Need to style the detailed table view for schema class. Done.
- isCanonocal in Pathway cannot be edited
- bug: regulation is not defined in RegulationReference. It is regulatedBy in the Java class model.
- Make sure to use undefined, not null, to make the coed consistent. Check with the table editing results. Right now: text returns "" and non-text returns null!
- bug: PathwayDiagram is not listed in the schema tree! Also check its display name generation.
- bug: the layers of compartment are not right now. Some compartments cannot get selected: http://localhost:4200/event_view/instance/157858, inside compartments, caused by the order of plotting compartments. This needs to be fixed.
- TODO: Set the color of icons in the event tree for dark mode. Right now, they are all black, which cannot be seen in the dark mode.
- Make sure the disease pathway diagram is correct. Right not it is not!
- Need some big refactoring for classes in the pathway diagram module: Right now they are all cross-linked together, esp. diagram service utils.
- For Figure instance: add a customized view to display the figure
- for no-instance edit, press return should commit the change. Control-return should add a new line. (now control+return commits the change)
- pathway diagram: deletion of a reaction in the diagram should delete that reaction. This applies to other object (e.g. a PE that is linked to a reaction).
- stoichioemtry update has not done yet for diagram update after instance editing.
- Add a check for event tree to see if there is any circular reference
- Imagine this scenario: A db instance is loaded. However, one of its attribute is deleted. Therefore, the view for the curator should see the instance without this deleted instance at browser. Should this instance be flagged as updated instance? Probably not since committing the deletion will handle this automatically. Also marking as updating will bring about some side effects (e.g. push to the local storage). But after the loading, the curator start to editing it. Now this instance is updated. Should the modified attributes include the attribute impacted by deletion, assuming the manul edited attribute is not that attribute. Probably we just need to introduce a new field in Instance, deletionImpactedAttribute? For the time being, just add the impacted attribute into the modified attribute list, but not mark it as updated. Need to revisit this later on.
- resize: need to make sure all associate attachments (e.g. modification, resizing widgets can be moved around).
- compartment id: since the same compartment can be added multiple times, therefore, we need a central way to manage id
- refactoring the menus for diagram editing: make them more streamlined.
- TODO: Better to come with a new implmenetation of finding all paths between two nodes instea of hacking the code for using aStar in hyperEdge.ts (enableRoundSegments and enableRoundSegmentsForFlowLine)
- data model: modified is single-valued in the current graph model
- TODO: Add a check for circular reference (e.g. precedingEvent): this should be avoided in any case!
- TODO: Check all code to make sure subscriptions are removed when a component is destroyed.
- TODO: Add an IE to referrers for the deleted instance at the server-side, return this IE so that we can manually add it to the local loaded referrers, including updated and deleted instances.
- TODO: deletion should clear up referrers attributes locally
- TODO: When a data service's query method is called via subscribe, the generated subscription cannot be subsribed autmoatically. Make sure use take(1) or manually unscribte it: https://devzilla.io/manage-rxjs-subscriptions-in-angular
- TODO: When a reaction is marked for deleted, this reaction in the diagram should be removed too. However, this may be difficult to handle since the reaction may not be displayed. Therefore, we will need some validation step to validate deleted or updated objects like this as in the Java curator tool.
- TODO: Need to disable the drag of nodes and edges in the legdend for the diagram view.
- TODO: doRelease in the event view has not been handled yet

# Deletion related document kept here for the time being
 * The following may need to be collected into some document for test cases in the doc folder:
 * Expected behavior of deleting an instance:
 * 1). There are two steps of deletion: 1). Local deletion 2). Commit the deletion to the server: the instance is removed
 * at the database
 * 2). Local deleltion: Mark the instance is deleted. This instance can still be viewed, but cannot be selected as an attribute value
 * 3). Commit the deletion to the database: The instance cannot be viewed anymore, and of course cannot be used.
 * 4). When an instance is marked for deletion (Step 1), the following should happen:
 * 4.1). The instance is listed in the deleteInstances list in the store
 * 4.2). The instance should be removed from displayed instance's attributes if it is used for both persisted instances
 * and new instances
 * 4.3). The instance should not be listed in the instance list
 * 4.4). The total count of the instance schema class and its ancestors should be updated by reducing 1 in the schema tree if it
 * is displayed (schema view)
 * 4.5). The total count of the page view for the instance list including this deleted instance should be updated by reducing 1.
 * 5). When an instance is committed for deletion (Step 2), the following should happen:
 * 5.1). The instance should be removed from the deleteInstances list in the store
 * 5.2). The instance should be removed from the cache
 * 5.3). The server-side will remove the instance from the database and add an InstanceEdit to the modified slot for all
 * referrers to this deleted instance.
 * 5.4). When a referrer is viewed at the front end, the user should see this added InstanceEdit in the modified slot.
 * Anything missing?
